/* Dev runner. Replaces `tsdown --watch --onSuccess "node ."`.
   Under turbo, the live task's output pipe stops being drained at a fixed
   point; the server's synchronous bootstrap writes then block forever and it
   wedges silently (alive, 0 CPU, no logs, port never bound). So the server's
   stdio goes to live-dev.log instead of turbo's pipe, and a health-checked
   supervisor respawns it if boot ever wedges anyway. */
/* eslint-disable no-await-in-loop -- this is a supervisor: the awaits are
   sequential on purpose (poll, then wait for exit, then respawn). Promise.all
   would defeat the point. */
